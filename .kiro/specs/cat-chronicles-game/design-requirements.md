# Cat Chronicles Game - Design & Requirements Specification

## Overview
A responsive, accessible educational game about Ancient Egypt featuring cats as protagonists. Built with React + TypeScript + Vite for optimal performance and maintainability.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Responsive Design (Multi-Screen Support)
**Target Devices:**
- Mobile phones (320px - 768px)
- Tablets (768px - 1024px) 
- Laptops (1024px - 1440px)
- Large screens (1440px+)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for fluid layouts
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness
- Fluid typography using clamp() for scalable text
- Touch-friendly interactions (44px minimum touch targets)
- Viewport-based units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax) for game area scaling
- Progressive enhancement from mobile-first approach

### 2. Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance)
**Visual Accessibility:**
- High contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Clear, readable fonts with fallbacks
- Scalable text up to 200% without horizontal scrolling
- Focus indicators with 2px outline and sufficient color contrast
- Alternative text for all images and interactive elements

**Interaction Accessibility:**
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility with ARIA labels
- Reduced motion support respecting user preferences
- Touch targets minimum 44px with adequate spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy and semantic HTML structure

**Color & Theme:**
- Maintain Ancient Egypt aesthetic while ensuring accessibility
- Test color combinations for colorblind users
- Provide high contrast mode option
- Use patterns/textures alongside color for information

### 3. Netlify Deployment Optimization
**Build Configuration:**
- Static site generation with Vite
- Asset optimization and compression
- Environment variable management
- Redirect rules for SPA routing
- Performance budgets and monitoring

```

### Responsive Breakpoints
```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
:root {
  --breakpoint-sm: 480px;   /* Large phones */
  --breakpoint-md: 768px;   /* Tablets */
  --breakpoint-lg: 1024px;  /* Laptops */
  --breakpoint-xl: 1440px;  /* Large screens */
}
```

### Accessibility Color Palette (WCAG AA Compliant)
```css
:root {
  /* High contrast versions of theme colors */
  --color-text-primary: #1a1a1a;        /* 15.3:1 contrast on papyrus */
  --color-text-secondary: #2c5f7a;      /* 4.8:1 contrast on papyrus */
  --color-interactive: #b8860b;         /* 4.5:1 contrast, accessible gold */
  --color-focus: #0066cc;               /* High contrast focus indicator */
  --color-error-accessible: #d32f2f;    /* 4.5:1 contrast ratio */
  --color-success-accessible: #2e7d32; /* 4.5:1 contrast ratio */
}
```

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Responsive Layout System
